		<!-- This following div (along with its CSS and javascript) for class "menu" and was created based on the navigation tutorial on https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sidenav.com. The overall implementation & idea for the menu bar is taken directly from this tutorial. I wanted to add this feature, but since I followed their tutorial + implementation, I will not count this as one of my three features (which I created on my own).-->
