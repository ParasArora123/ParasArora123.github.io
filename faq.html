		</div>
		<div class="faq-answers">
			Yes! The CDC has recanted their previous statment that masks do not prevent the spread of Covid-19 and reccomend "wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission." <br><br>Please visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html to learn more.

			<p>Yes, under our donate section we offer a place where you can make a monetary donation. While our main purpose is to help with the current PPE crisis, every donation helps someone in some way. We do not collect the donation ourselves but rather send you to another reputable site to make a donation. </p>
